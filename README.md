## Work Experience

**Nozawa Onsen Ski School** (Autumn 2015 - Spring 2016)  
_Ski Instructor_

- Developed strong working relationships with clients by communicating effectively to encourage active participation and optimise enjoyment and progression within the lessons

- Planned lessons carefully and appropriately based on the clientâ€™s ability

- Good organisation, attention to detail, as well as creativity and enthusiasm were fundamental to the success of the lessons

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?

#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2021 - July 2021)

- Built web apps in Ruby and JavaScript, ranging from 2-3 day individual projects to 1-2 week group projects, as part of a 12 week intensive curriculum
- Learned independently and collaboratively in group projects through pair programming
- Worked using a modern Agile methodology, including standups, retros, and sprint planning
- Learned and applied various software design principles (OOP, TDD, MVC, SOLID)
- Developed familiarity with git version control and CI/CD (Travis, Circle CI, Heroku)
- Created [an educational web-app](https://team-hang-git.herokuapp.com/) to help aspiring developers become familiar with git commands. Used MongoDB, Node and Express to build an API which serves a React frontend. Tested with Jest/React Testing Libary.
- Developed [a social media app](https://aqueous-harbor-18057.herokuapp.com/) using rails, hosted on Heroku, with a PostgreSQL database. API manages CRUD operations.

#### University of Leicester (2016 - 2019)

- BSc Chemistry
- 2:1
- Required analytical thinking to gather critical insights from experimental data
- Continuously developing problem solving skills, often breaking down problems into smaller, more manageable tasks

## Hobbies

I have enjoyed playing the drums for 13 years, particularly in bands at live gigs. I love bouldering and challenging myself with new problems. I also enjoy skiing and powerlifting.
