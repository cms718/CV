## Charlie Slater

BSc Chemistry graduate from the University of Leicester. I completed a React course on Udemy and a Python course on Codecademy, which sparked my interest in software development. Recently graduated from Makers software bootcamp where I was taught the importance of best coding practices. I'd love to work in a supportive environment where those practices are followed.

## Work Experience

**Nozawa Onsen Ski School** (Autumn 2015 - Spring 2016)  
_Ski Instructor_

- Developed strong working relationships with clients by communicating effectively to encourage active participation and optimise enjoyment and progression within the lessons

- Planned lessons carefully and appropriately based on the client’s ability

- Good organisation, attention to detail, as well as creativity and enthusiasm were fundamental to the success of the lessons

**Screen With Envy** (November 2020 - March 2021)  
_Warehouse Operative_

- Responsible for picking, packing, stock check and other duties.

## Skills

#### Initiative

While doing a project as part of the Makers course, I noticed that our codebase was inconsistent which was making it difficult to review PR’s. To fix this, I instigated and coordinated the adoption of the Airbnb react style guide standards.

In another role as a warehouse operative, I noticed an inefficiency in the stock layout and suggested an improvement. The suggestion was immediately implemented, and resulted in a measurable increase in daily orders dispatched.

#### Interpersonal Skills

Working as a ski instructor required communication of difficult to express ideas about body mechanics. I developed several methods of abstracting concepts to explain them in a beginner-friendly way. This improved my ability to exchange ideas in a clear way.

Additionally, I have played in multiple bands, which involves regular group practice. As part of this, we would often have to discuss individual performance in specific sections or songs. This has made me adept at giving open constructive feedback in a friendly manner, as well as reflecting and improving on feedback that I am given.

#### Fast Learner

I went from no musical background to grade 8 standard on drums in just 3 years, this made it possible for me to join a band at 15 doing paid gigs at pubs and functions.

As part of the Makers final project we needed to set up a backend using a stack that wasn't part of the course. Using only online documentation and my own intuition, I was able to learn enough to deploy it in 1 day by myself. Backend can be found [**here**](https://github.com/cms718/hang-git-backend).

#### Desire to Learn & Improve

I initially started self teaching software development using resources such as Codecademy and Udemy, but wasn't happy with the pace of my progression. I sought out a bootcamp to accelerate this. As a result, I am not only more comfortable with programming itself but also with best practices, working in a team, and time management.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2021 - July 2021)

- Built web apps in Ruby and JavaScript, ranging from 2-3 day individual projects to 1-2 week group projects, as part of a 12 week intensive curriculum
- Learned independently and collaboratively in group projects through pair programming
- Worked using a modern Agile methodology, including standups, retros, and sprint planning
- Learned and applied various software design principles (OOP, TDD, MVC, SOLID)
- Developed familiarity with git version control and CI/CD (Travis, Circle CI, Heroku)

#### University of Leicester (2016 - 2019)

- BSc Chemistry
- 2:1
- Required analytical thinking to gather critical insights from experimental data
- Continuously developed problem solving skills, often breaking down problems into smaller, more manageable tasks

## Hobbies

I have enjoyed playing the drums for 13 years, particularly in bands at live gigs. I love bouldering and challenging myself with new problems. I also enjoy skiing and powerlifting.
