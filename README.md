(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

## Hobbies

I have enjoyed playing the drums for 13 years, learning new music and bettering my ability through practice. I particularly enjoy performing in a band at live gigs!
I also love bouldering, challenging myself with new problems both mentally and physically, and always giving myself something new to work towards.
